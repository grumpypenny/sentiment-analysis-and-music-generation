*Use the following instructions as we resolve a bug with the abc2midi conversion library:*
- After inputting text, it will output a file called `out.abc` in the same directory as `main.py`
- Copy/Paste the contents of this text file to [online abc to midi converter](https://www.mandolintab.net/abcconverter.php) and download the `.midi` file generated
- This `.midi` file can then be opened in an audio editing software such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to view and play the generated musical notes
