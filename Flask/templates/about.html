            The goal of this project is to create unique music based on text given by a user by using revolutionary Machine Learning models. <br/><br/>Given a sad story it will generate sad music. Likewise given a happy tale we get joyful music.<br/><br/> This can be used to content creators to generate music based on video and movie scripts and can also be used while reading a novel to generate music in the background based on the read text.
            <br/><br/>
            This project was created by two University of Toronto Students, Ajitesh Misra and Sharven Prasad Dhanasekar
