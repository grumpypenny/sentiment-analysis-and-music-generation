
Instructions for Compiling with Pacific C (for the PC)
------------------------------------------------------
Pacific C is distributed free by Hi-Tech Software. There is a standalone
compiler, but it is difficult to write makefiles for, so here are some
instructions for compiling from PPD, which provides an integrated development 
environment(IDE). If you use another compiler with an IDE, these instructions
should give you an idea of how to go about compiling the code on your system.

You should create a separate project file for each program with
Make -> New project

For abc2midi you need C source files:
queues.c
midifile.c
store.c
genmidi.c
parseabc.c
parser2.c

For midi2abc you need C source files:
midi2abc.c
midifile.c

For abc2abc you need C source files:
toabc.c
parseabc.c

For yaps you need C source files:
position.c
pslib.c
yapstree.c
drawtune.c
debug.c
parseabc.c
parser2.c

To compile all files, you need to set a macro
Make -> CPP pre-defined symbols
-DANSILIBS
This causes the necessary ANSI libraries to be included.

[ Note: I do not regularly maintain this file. If these instructions
  do not work, check the files against those given in the makefiles ]

For yaps you also need to include the floating point library with
Options -> Use Floating Point Lib
and also set
Options -> Memory Model and chip type  to  80186 and Large Memory Model
